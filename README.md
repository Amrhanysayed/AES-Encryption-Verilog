# üîê AES Encryption Using Verilog 

## Overview

This FPGA project implements AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) encryption using Verilog. AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm widely used for securing sensitive data. The project provides support for **128-bit, 192-bit, or 256-bit** cipher keys and operates on a state matrix to perform encryption steps.

The project is designed to be modular, enabling easy integration into FPGA platforms. It can be synthesized and deployed using Quartus and is compatible with simulation tools like ModelSim for verification.

Additionally, the state matrix is hardcoded into the main module, which is editable, along with the three different key lengths (128, 192, and 256). The project features four switches: one to enable 128-bit encryption, another for 192-bit, one for 256-bit, and one for reset (registered into SW[0:3]). The clock is mimicked by KEY[0] on the FPGA.

Furthermore, the project includes an encoder to convert the last 1 byte to BCD and a decoder to display the last 3 digits of that BCD on a 7-segment screen (HEX0, HEX1, and HEX2).

# AES Encryption Verilog Implementation

This project provides a Verilog implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption algorithm. The implementation supports key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits, making it suitable for various security requirements. It is designed specifically for use in Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).

## Features

- Verilog implementation of the AES encryption algorithm.
- Supports key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits.
- Optimized for FPGA implementation.
- Modular design for easy integration into FPGA projects.
- Includes project files and a scientific reference PDF named "NIST.FIPS.197" for further information.
